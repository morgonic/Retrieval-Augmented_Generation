# Reflection

The document that I selected is the Wikipedia page for punk rock music. Originally, I wanted to use the Wikipedia page for Rage Against The Machine, but somehow it wasn't able to be scraped properly. However, using the same code, I was able to scrape the punk rock Wikipedia page.

The punk rock Wikipedia page consists of the history of punk rock, notable punk rock bands, characteristics, and visual, musical and lyrical elements of the genre. It also contains information about different eras of punk rock's development, the genres that inspired it, and the genres that emerged as a result of inspiration from punk rock.

## Questions & Answers
1. **Why does the embedding dimensionality matter in a RAG pipeline, and how is it determined?**
    - Embedding dimensionality determines the vector space in which semantic similarity is measured. In FAISS, all vectors in the index must have the same fixed dimension ‚Äî it defines the geometry of comparison. The dimensionality is determined by the embedding model (e.g., all-distilroberta-v1 outputs 768-dimensional vectors). A mismatch between the embedding size and the FAISS index will trigger errors or degrade retrieval quality. Higher dimensions allow for richer semantic representation, but may increase computational cost and memory usage.

2. **How does FAISS's IndexFlatL2 perform similarity search, and why use it over other indexes?**
    - IndexFlatL2 performs an exact search using Euclidean (L2) distance. It computes the distance between the query vector and all vectors in the index and returns the top k closest matches. It's simple and accurate, ideal for small to medium-sized datasets where speed isn't a bottleneck. In contrast, for larger-scale retrieval (e.g. millions of vectors), approximate methods like IndexIVFFlat or HNSW are preferred for faster retrieval at the cost of some accuracy.

3. **How does chunk overlap improve context quality, and when can it backfire?**
    - Chunk overlap (e.g. 10‚Äì20% of chunk size) helps preserve continuity of ideas that span across boundaries ‚Äî especially useful when a sentence or paragraph splits mid-thought. This improves recall and reduces semantic fragmentation.
    However, high overlap increases index size and may introduce redundant information, causing retrieval of near-duplicate chunks. This can confuse the generator (e.g., when it receives the same fact twice in slightly different wording) and bloat memory usage.

4. **How should prompts be designed in the generator to reduce hallucinations and improve groundedness?**
    - Good prompt design in RAG provides clear instruction, structured context, and scope.
    - For example:
        - "Answer the question based only on the following context:\n\n{context}\n\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:"
    - Key tips:
        - Use the phrase "based only on the following context" to restrict model behavior.
        - Keep context under token limits (e.g., < 1024 tokens for T5-small).
        - Avoid ambiguous wording -- the more literal the prompt, the better small models perform.
    - Advanced techniques like few-shot examples, separators, or tag-based formats (e.g., <context>...</context>) can further improve control.

5. **What are the trade-offs between small vs large embedding models in terms of RAG performance?**
    - Small models (like all-MiniLM or distilroberta) are fast, lightweight, and perform reasonably well for general semantic similarity. They're ideal for low-resource or real-time applications.
    - Large models (like multi-qa-mpnet-base or e5-large) produce more precise embeddings, especially for complex queries or technical content ‚Äî but require more memory and compute.
    - In RAG systems, larger embedding models generally yield better retrieval quality, which improves generation accuracy ‚Äî but only if the generator is strong enough to take advantage of that precision.

# Conclusions and Trends Observed in Testing

## Conclusion:
- Chunk size and chunk overlap do affect the accuracy and quality of the answers. 
- The first test, using chunk size 500 and an overlap of 50 (178 chunks), produced the best factual accuracy, like designating Lester Bangs as the man to coin the term 'punk rock', but sometimes had shallow information, as if context were cut off.
- The tests that had a chunk size of 1000 and an overlap of 50-100 (94 chunks) produced balanced answers but did hallucinate answers (for example, when referencing Ed Sanders and X-Ray Spex).
- The tests that had a chunk size of 2000 and an overlap of 50-600 (42-46 chunks) produced what seemed like more confident answers but included even more hallucinations, such as when referring to "The Meteors" or giving "Punk rock" as an answer to who invented punk rock.
- The test that had a chunk size of 1000 and an overlap of 200 (96 chunks) got some questions wrong, but performed better than the tests with 2000-size chunks.

### Trends:
- The higher the chunk size, the higher the hallucinations.
- Higher chunk overlap helps a little bit with continuity but doesn't help with accuracy or hallucinations.
- Chunks with a size of 500-1000 and an overlap of 100-200 consistently produce better answers, seeming to have enough context for reasoning without much hallucinating.
